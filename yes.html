      <h1>bae,</h1>
      <p>
        You know that once I learn something, I would like to try and get better always if I have a chance.
        I learned how to create websites because of you. I simply love to watch you developing, creating, coding, everyday. 
        I always have so many questions to you about it, but the thing that I love the most is when you ask my opinion about your work.
        oi lindo, meu amor, my babe, mamai, my life, my angel, my air, my life, my whole world. We started this dream journey with our eyes
        completly sparking to each other, I had tears on my yes at the minute that I said yes to you, and I could see an entire galaxy 
        inside your eyes. From that day till now, this is how my eyes shine for you every single day. You know that, because sometimes when
        you say something cute, automatically my eyes got completly full of tears, and it's not in a sad way, is in the most happy way possible,
        because I want to cry everyday of happiness because I have you. & you it's all that I need and want for my life.
        That halloween night when we got married, that was the best thing that you already did with me, because deep in my heart you'll forever will be my husband. Just like that day at the beache
        when you propose me, from that day untill forever, I will always be your fiance and you my future husband.
        I know that things are not easy for us right now, but I also now that my wish to make us right is bigger than anything that i ever felt in my life.
        You are the joy of my days babe. You are the one that I crave every hour of my day. I desperately need to touch you, feel you, smell you, look at you, you are like a drug to me, 
        the kind that I love being addicted to and completely dependent on.
        I am completely devoted to you, I love that you order me around, that you decide things for us, when you tell me to shut up, I love being submissive to you and to all the commands you give me. 
        I love being yours and belonging to you. What I have always wanted and will always want for us is a world full of laughter, Netflix and chill, sunsets, hugs, unexpected kisses, holding your hand, 
        long car rides singing our favorite songs, FaceTimes while we are apart, thousands of joints and soju on a sultry night followed by lots of love to give to each other. I want you, only and exclusively you. 
        I want to show you that I make you happy and that it is worth being together. 
        I want to make you feel proud to have me by your side in special moments.
        My love, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me in this life, I am grateful and I thank God every day for having made our paths cross.
        in every step of our journey, i wish for us to walk side by side, embracing the unknown. life may present its share of mysteries, but amidst it all, one thing remains crystal clear: my unwaving choice to be with you. 
        This is the relationship i wholeheartedly yearn for, where our love transcends time and space, destined to endure for as much as we can be together. 
        togethere, let us create a story that defies the limits of possibility and etches our ove into the very fabric of existence. 
        I don't wanna lose the only real thing that I have in my life, and this is you. Only you. Forever in my mind and in my heart I will remember every single laugh, kiss, smile, hug, everything, all to well. 
        Can you be mine one more time? 
        
        Please, stay. I want you, I need you. Don't take these beautiful thing that WE'VE got.❤️
